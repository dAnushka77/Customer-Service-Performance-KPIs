# Customer-Service-Performance-KPIs

Project: Customer Service Performance Dashboard Using KPIs

Project Description: Create a dashboard to track and analyze customer service performance for a fictional company (or real-world data if available). This project will demonstrate your ability to define relevant KPIs, collect and process data, and use data visualization tools to provide actionable insights for improving customer service operations.


# 1. Project Objective:
   
The goal of this project is to design a dashboard that tracks critical KPIs for a customer service department, identifies areas for improvement, and presents data insights to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.


# 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

You will track the following KPIs to measure the performance of the customer service department:


Average Response Time: The average time it takes for a customer service representative to respond to a customer inquiry.

First Contact Resolution Rate (FCR): Percentage of customer issues resolved on the first interaction.

Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): Customer feedback on their satisfaction with the service received.

Net Promoter Score (NPS): A measure of how likely customers are to recommend the company to others.

Average Handling Time (AHT): The average time taken to resolve a customer's issue.

Ticket Volume: The number of support tickets received in a given period.

Escalation Rate: Percentage of cases that are escalated to higher levels of support.

Agent Utilization Rate: A measure of how effectively customer service agents are using their time.


# 3. Data Collection:

You can create synthetic data or use real-world datasets from sources like Kaggle or your previous experiences. The data should include:


Ticket IDs, timestamps (open and closed), customer satisfaction ratings, agent response times, escalation details, and NPS data.

If using real-world data is an option, try using publicly available customer service datasets or simulate customer interactions.


# 4. Tools & Technologies:

Python/Pandas: For data cleaning, processing, and analysis.

SQL: For querying data from a database (if you simulate storing data in a relational database).

Power BI/Tableau/Excel: To create interactive dashboards that visualize KPIs.

DAX/Power Query: To manipulate and calculate KPIs within Power BI.

# 5. Methodology:

Data Preparation:


Clean and preprocess the data (remove duplicates, handle missing values).

Convert timestamps to calculate durations (response time, handling time).

Create columns for CSAT and NPS scores from customer feedback.


KPI Calculation:


Average Response Time: Calculate the difference between the first response timestamp and the ticket open time.

FCR Rate: Divide the number of tickets resolved on the first interaction by the total number of tickets.

CSAT: Compute the average customer satisfaction score.

NPS: Use a 1-10 scale to categorize responses into "Promoters," "Detractors," and "Passives" and calculate NPS using the formula:

NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

AHT: Calculate the total handling time and divide it by the total number of resolved tickets.


# 6. Dashboard Creation:

Dashboard Layout:

Summary Section: Highlight key KPIs such as average response time, FCR rate, CSAT, and NPS at the top.

Charts & Visualizations:

Line Charts: Show trends for KPIs like response time and handling time over time.

Bar Charts: Display the volume of tickets by category (support type, priority, etc.).

Gauge Charts: Indicate current NPS and CSAT against the target values.

Heatmaps: Show performance by agent or time of day.

Drill-Down Functionality: Allow users to drill into specific categories (e.g., agent performance, ticket type).

# 7. Analysis and Recommendations:

Perform analysis on the KPIs to identify bottlenecks or areas where performance is below target.

For example, if the First Contact Resolution Rate is low, suggest training programs or improvements in documentation.

If Average Handling Time is high, propose process improvements or automation to assist agents.

# 8. Project Deliverables:

Dashboard: A fully interactive dashboard with all KPIs displayed.

Documentation: A report or PowerPoint explaining your methodology, data sources, KPI definitions, and insights from the dashboard.

Code: Python/SQL scripts used for data processing and analysis.

Presentation: Showcase your findings and explain how the insights can help improve customer service.
