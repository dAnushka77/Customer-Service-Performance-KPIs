## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design a comprehensive dashboard that tracks critical KPIs for a customer service department. The dashboard identifies performance gaps, highlights strengths, and presents insights to improve customer satisfaction and operational workflows.

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs are tracked to measure customer service performance:

- **Average Response Time**: Average time to respond to a customer inquiry.
- **First Contact Resolution Rate (FCR)**: Percentage of issues resolved on the first interaction.
- **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**: Average customer feedback score for service satisfaction.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Likelihood of customers recommending the company to others.
- **Average Handling Time (AHT)**: Average time spent resolving a customer issue.
- **Ticket Volume**: Number of tickets processed in a given period.
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of cases escalated to higher support levels.
- **Agent Utilization Rate**: Efficiency of customer service agents in handling tickets.

---

## Data Collection

- **Synthetic Data**: Simulated customer service ticket data, including:
  - Ticket IDs
  - Timestamps (open and closed)
  - CSAT ratings
  - Agent response times
  - Escalation details
  - NPS feedback
- **Real-World Data**: If available, publicly sourced customer service datasets or prior experience can be used.

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **Data Processing**:
  - Python (pandas, numpy)
  - SQL (for querying data from a relational database)
- **Dashboard Creation**:
  - Power BI / Tableau / Excel
- **Data Manipulation**:
  - DAX / Power Query (within Power BI)

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

1. **Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Handle missing values.
2. **Processing**:
   - Convert timestamps to calculate durations (response and handling times).
   - Create new columns for CSAT and NPS from customer feedback.

### KPI Calculation

1. **Average Response Time**: Time between ticket open and first response.
2. **First Contact Resolution (FCR) Rate**: 
   \[
   \text{FCR Rate} = \frac{\text{Tickets Resolved on First Interaction}}{\text{Total Tickets}}
   \]
3. **CSAT**: Average customer satisfaction score.
4. **NPS**: Using a 1-10 scale:
   - Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), Detractors (0-6)
   \[
   \text{NPS} = (\% \text{Promoters}) - (\% \text{Detractors})
   \]
5. **AHT**: Total handling time divided by resolved tickets.

## Dashboard Features

- **Summary Section**: Key KPIs like response time, FCR, CSAT, and NPS.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Line Charts: KPI trends over time.
  - Bar Charts: Ticket volume by category (support type, priority).
  - Gauge Charts: Current NPS and CSAT compared to targets.
  - Heatmaps: Agent performance or time-of-day activity.
- **Drill-Down Functionality**: Analyze specific metrics (e.g., agent performance).

---

## Analysis and Recommendations

Insights based on KPI analysis to optimize operations:
- **Low FCR Rate**: Suggest training or improving documentation.
- **High AHT**: Propose automation tools or process optimization.
- **Escalation Trends**: Identify patterns and address root causes.
